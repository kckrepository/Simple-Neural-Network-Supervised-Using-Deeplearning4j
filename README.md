# Simple-Neural-Network-Supervised-Using-Deeplearning4j

This simple project is to implement neural network supervised using deeplearning4j.
We'll write the “Hello World” of machine learning — classification of the iris flower data set. 
This is a set of data that was gathered from the flowers of different species (Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica).

The first layer should contain the same amount of nodes as the columns in the training data (4).
The second dense layer will contain three nodes. This is the value we can variate, but the number of outputs in the previous layer has to be the same.
The final output layer should contain the number of nodes matching the number of classes (3). The structure of the network is shown in the picture:
